# PROBLEM: Given a singly linked list, write a function which 
# takes in the first node in a singly linked list and returns a boolean indicating if the linked list contains a "cycle".
# A cycle is when a node's next point acutally points back to a previous node in the list.
# This is also sometimes known as a circularly linked list.
