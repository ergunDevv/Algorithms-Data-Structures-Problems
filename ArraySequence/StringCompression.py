# PROBLEM: Given a string in the form 'AAABBBBCCCCCDDEEEE' compress it to become 'A4B4C5D2E4'
# For this problem, you can falsely "compress" strings of single of double letters.
# For instance, it is okay for 'AAB' to return 'A2B1' even though this technically 
# takes more space. The function should also be case sensetive, so that a string 
# 'AAAaaa' returns 'A3a3'
